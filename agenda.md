## April 15

### Morning: Lewis Room
- 8:00 am: Coffee
- 8:30 am: Welcome and introductions (Carl and Matt and Arfon and Yolanda)
    - Plenary intro to group & goals (Carl)
- 9:30 am: Brainstorming: software metadata concepts, and associated use cases (Jones moderates)
    - Post-its: use case and metadata concepts
    - Whiteboard clustering and prioritization of use cases
- 10:30 am Break
- 11:00 am: Introduction to existing vocabularies
    - Overview of existing crosswalk table (Matt)
    - 5 minutes each: software metadata creation story and use cases
        - Zenodo (Kris), Figshare (Mark), Software Ontology, Software Discovery Index, Data Cite (Martin), Software Entities Model (Martin?), R Packages (Carl)
        - Schema.org, Dublin Core
- 12:00 Lunch

### Afternoon

- 1:30 pm Breakouts (3)
    - Breakout goals and introduction (identify groups, moderator, and notetaker)
        - Explain tools for collaborative work
        - Google doc version of spreadsheet
        - Google doc notes docuemnt
    - Each group focuses on 2-3 schema mappings to the generic concepts
    - Group A: Zenodo, Software Ontology, __________
    - Group B: FIgShare, R Package Description, __________
    - Group C: DataCite, Software Discovery Index, _________
    - Goal: Review, revise, and extend crosswalk
    - Groups identify:
        - Problem areas in crosswalk, where mapping is controversial
        - New additions to the crosswalk concepts

- 3:30 pm: Break
- 4:00 pm: Plenary
    - Report backs
    - Conflict merging/ consensus decisions

- 7:00 pm Group Dinner (Location TBA)

## April 16

Morning
8:30 Coffee
9:00: Plenary: JSON-LD: Intro to the schema (Arfon)
    - Q&A, Review/feedback of schema approach
9:45: Use Case Breakouts (3)
    - Introduce use case breakouts (Carl)
    - Each group assigned 2-3 use cases
    - For each use case:
        - Review for completeness and adequacy to represent concepts in the use case
        - Create one or more example records following the schema for various use cases
        - Upload example documents to GitHub (via PR?)

- 12:00 Lunch

- Afternoon
- 1:30 pm: Application use case / vision (plenary) (who?)
- 2:30 pm: Breakout into 3 design sessions
  - R software package / software implementation criteria
  - Lagotto software citation counting
  - Journal Article: outline software metadata crosswalk paper

## April 17

- Afternooon, 1:30 to 5:00 pm, with break
- Introductions (15 minutes)
- Overview presentation (15+15 questions)
    - CodeMeta motivation
    - Emphasize connections to other workshops (e.g., SCWG)
    - Present the use cases
    - Review the crosswalk schema, and use case adequacy
- Discussion: How can CodeMeta enable Software Citation? (45 mins)
    - Implementation feedback, additional recommendations for SCWG, and vice versa
- Break (3-3:30)
- CodeMeta Use cases (75 mins)
    - Discussion: do CodeMeta use cases adequately cover by the crosswalk
    - i.e. Software dependencies: what to include, what use cases you can adequately address, what you cannot.  (transitive credit? Installing?)
- Concluding discussion (15 mins)
