Research relies heavily on scientific software, and a large and growing fraction of researchers are engaged in developing software as part of their own research [Hannay et al 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155). Despite this, _infrastructure to  support the preservation, discovery, reuse, and attribution of software_ lags substantially behind that of other research products such as journal  articles and research data. This lag is driven not so much by a lack of  technology as it is by a lack of unity: existing mechanisms to archive,  document, index, share, discover, and cite software contributions are heterogeneous among both disciplines and archives and rarely meet best practices [Howison 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23538).

## How can we make this better?

Fortunately, a rapidly growing movement to improve preservation, discovery, reuse and attribution of academic software is now underway: a recent [NIH report](http://softwarediscoveryindex.org), conferences and working groups of [Force11](https://www.force11.org/), [WSSSPE](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/) & [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/), the rising adoption of repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [figshare](https://figshare.com) & [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org).

The CodeMeta project does not seek to create [yet another standard](https://xkcd.com/927/).  Rather, we're aiming to _create a map_ between standards already in use -- think of this as a Rosetta stone of software metadata.  Thanks to a generous [NSF EAGER Grant]() 


## What is software metadata?

What metadata you want from software is determined by your use case.  If your primary concerns are credit for academic software, then you're most interested in _citation_ metadata.  If you're trying to replicate some analysis, you worry more about versions and dependencies than about authors and titles.  And if you seek to discover software you don't already know about that is suitable for a particular task, well then you are interested more in keywords and descriptions. Frequently, developers of scientific software, repositories that host that software, and users themselves are interested in more than one of these objectives, and others besides.
